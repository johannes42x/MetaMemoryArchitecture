## 0. Purpose

The MetaMemoryWorks Restricted License (MMW-RL) governs the use, modification,
distribution, reimplementation, and integration of all MetaMemoryWorks modules,
architectures, specifications, file bundles, engines, methods, schemas,
templates, presets, and derivative works — whether distributed as text, JSON,
YAML, Markdown, code, documentation, or reconstructed through interaction with
a large language model (LLM).

The license protects **both the method and the product**.

Licensing obligations **persist regardless of format, medium, model, runtime,
transformation, or reimplementation technique**.

---

## 1. Allowed Uses (Free, Non-Commercial, Individual Only)

The following uses are permitted **without charge**:

- strictly personal, private, non-commercial use by individuals;
- **personal academic learning by individuals** (e.g., students studying or
  experimenting independently), 
  **excluding all institutional, supervised, or funded research activities**;
- private experimentation and modification, provided no third party benefits
  commercially.

These permissions apply regardless of file format, runtime, storage backend,
or model provider.

No attribution is required for private individual use.

---

## 2. Prohibited Uses (Absolutely Forbidden)

The following uses are categorically prohibited:

- military organizations, military research, defense contractors, dual-use
  development, weapons systems;
- intelligence agencies, surveillance operations, population-monitoring
  systems;
- law-enforcement predictive analytics, profiling, coercive control systems;
- psychological manipulation, behavioral influence, or exploitative systems;
- harmful, abusive, or rights-violating applications;
- medical or legal decision-making without certified professional oversight;
- any system intended to deceive, exploit, or manipulate populations.

These prohibitions apply regardless of whether the method is used directly,
reimplemented, rewritten, or reconstructed through an LLM.

---

## 3. Commercial and Institutional Use (License Required)

Any of the following require **explicit written permission** and a
**commercial licensing agreement**:

- corporate, governmental, organizational, or NGO use;
- integration into paid products or services;
- internal use within companies or institutions, even if not publicly deployed;
- embedding MetaMemoryWorks architectures into LLM agents, APIs, pipelines,
  or automation systems;
- commercial consulting, training, or data-analysis workflows;
- **all institutional academic research**, including: 
  - university projects 
  - supervised research 
  - PhD, PostDoc, or faculty research 
  - laboratory or consortium research 
  - grant-funded or sponsored research 
  - research that contributes to institutional output or publications

Absence of payment does **not** imply non-commercial status. 
Any use by an institution is considered commercial by default.

---

## 4. Method and Architecture Protection

This license protects **both**:

1. **The method** — including the Represent → Assign → Persist → Use cycle,
   memory semantics, architectural expectations, and behavioral structures; 
2. **The product** — any files, templates, schemas, logs, engines, or bundles
   shipped under MetaMemoryWorks.

Rewriting, reformatting, renaming, fragmenting, or independently recreating
the method does **not** remove licensing obligations.

**Independent reinvention does not exempt an implementation.**

---

## 5. Functional Equivalence Clause

Any system is considered a **derivative implementation** if it reproduces,
in any form or terminology, any of the **architectural patterns** defined by
MetaMemoryWorks, including but not limited to:

- persistent external memory structures;
- append-only or history-preserving state management;
- multi-file or multi-location assignment of representations;
- structural expectations that guide LLM behavior;
- file-driven or schema-driven normalization;
- reconstruction of the Represent → Assign → Persist → Use cycle;
- engines or methods that induce similar emergent behavior in LLMs.

Naming, formatting, or conceptual reframing does not alter this status.

---

## 6. Format / Media / Model / Runtime Shift Clause

Licensing obligations persist under all transformations, including:

- file format changes (JSON ↔ YAML ↔ DB ↔ Markdown, etc.);
- media changes (local files, cloud storage, embedded vectors, LLM memory);
- summarization, rewriting, compression, or re-expression by LLMs;
- model changes (different LLM providers, custom models, hybrid systems);
- runtime changes (Python, JS, compiled architectures, cloud platforms);
- engine rewrites, module restructuring, or refactoring.

**No transformation nullifies the license.**

---

## 7. Anti-Evasion Clause

The following do **not** constitute ways to bypass this license:

- renaming or relocating files;
- altering field names, schemas, or storage strategies;
- splitting or merging modules;
- rewriting from scratch while preserving architecture;
- replacing terminology ("log", "notebook", "memory", etc.);
- reconstructing the method through an LLM;
- using embeddings, vector stores, or graph DBs as memory backends;
- simulating or approximating behavior to avoid explicit copying.

If the system **behaves** according to the architectural patterns described
here, it is legally a derivative implementation.

---

## 8. Redistribution

Redistribution of MetaMemoryWorks material in **unaltered form** is permitted
for non-commercial purposes, provided:

- this license remains attached, and 
- attribution to MetaMemoryWorks is preserved.

Redistribution with modifications is allowed **only for private,
non-commercial individual use**.

Commercial redistribution requires a license.

---

## 9. Warranty, Liability, and Safety

MetaMemoryWorks is provided **as-is**, without warranty of any kind. 
No guarantee is made regarding accuracy, safety, or fitness for purpose. 
Users assume full responsibility for outcomes.

MetaMemoryWorks is **not** a medical, legal, psychological, or financial authority.
Critical decisions require certified professional oversight.

---

## 10. Termination

Any unlicensed commercial use or prohibited use immediately terminates all rights. 
Upon termination, all use and distribution must cease.

---

## 11. Jurisdiction

For private, non-commercial use, governing law defaults to the user's place of
residence unless otherwise required. 
Commercial licenses may specify different jurisdiction.
