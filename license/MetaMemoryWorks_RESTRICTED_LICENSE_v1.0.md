## SUMMARY

The MetaMemoryWorks Restricted License governs the use, reproduction, extension, and implementation of the **MetaMemoryArchitecture** (the “Method”), including all specifications, structures, formats, examples, schemas, and procedural descriptions contained in this repository.

This license protects **both the method and its implementations**, whether partial or complete, rewritten or transformed, file-based or engine-based, local or cloud-executed.

Private personal use is free. 
Academic research requires prior permission. 
Commercial or institutional use requires a commercial license. 
Military, coercive, oppressive, or harmful use is strictly prohibited.

---

# 1. ALLOWED USE

## 1.1 Private, Personal Use — Free
Natural persons may:

- use the Method privately, 
- create private derivative works, 
- modify or adapt the Method locally, 
- run, experiment with, or extend the architecture for non-commercial purposes.

Private derivatives must remain **private**. 
They may not be published, redistributed, or deployed commercially.

The Licensor assumes **no liability** for private derivatives.

---

# 2. ACADEMIC / RESEARCH USE

Academic or research use is generally allowed **but requires prior written permission** from the Licensor.

This includes:

- university research, 
- laboratory work, 
- academic prototyping, 
- student theses or academic projects.

Permission is required to prevent misuse by military, intelligence, or coercive institutions disguised as research organizations.

---

# 3. COMMERCIAL, INSTITUTIONAL, OR ORGANIZATIONAL USE  
### — Requires a Commercial License —

Any use by companies, startups, NGOs, governmental bodies, or other institutions requires explicit prior written permission.

This includes:

- internal tooling, 
- integration into products or services, 
- derivative engines, 
- training pipelines using the Method, 
- cloud services implementing the Method, 
- workflow automation tools, 
- enterprise memory systems, 
- any application involving paying customers or operational deployment.

No commercial or institutional user has automatic rights under this license.

---

# 4. PROHIBITED USE

The following uses are strictly forbidden:

- **Military applications** 
- **Weapons development or targeting systems** 
- **Intelligence, surveillance, or coercive systems** 
- **Human rights violations or oppressive contexts** 
- **Psychological manipulation or exploitation** 
- **Clinical or medical decision-making without appropriate certification** 
- **Any harmful or abusive application**

Permission cannot be granted for these categories under any circumstances.

---

# 5. DERIVATIVE WORKS

## 5.1 Definition
A derivative work includes any system that reproduces:

- the MetaMemoryArchitecture method, 
- its procedural workflow (read → validate → reconstruct → extend → persist), 
- its multi-file or document-based memory model, 
- its structured/unstructured memory object classes, 
- its functional behaviour or interpretive logic.

Rewriting from scratch DOES NOT exempt a system from being a derivative.

## 5.2 Private Derivative Works
Private users may create derivatives **for personal, private use only**.

They may **not**:

- publish, 
- distribute, 
- share, 
- sell, 
- or deploy derivatives.

## 5.3 Commercial Derivative Works
Any derivative used outside private personal use is **license-bound** and requires commercial licensing.

The Licensor assumes no liability for any derivative work.

---

# 6. SHIFT CLAUSES (EXTENDED)

## 6.1 Format-Shift Clause  
Changing the file format **does not** remove licensing obligations.

Covered formats include, but are not limited to:

JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, TXT, MD, HTML, TOML, databases, proprietary formats, binary blobs, encrypted containers.

## 6.2 Media-Shift Clause  
Changing the medium **does not** remove licensing obligations.

Covered media include:

text, audio, video, GUI output, dashboards, avatars, VR/AR, mobile apps, desktop apps, cloud APIs, agents, synthetic personas.

## 6.3 Engine-Shift Clause  
Implementing the Method inside a different engine, runtime, or coordination layer — including agent frameworks, pipelines, LLM toolchains, or cloud-based orchestration engines — **does not** remove licensing obligations.

## 6.4 Runtime-Shift Clause  
Running the Method on-device, in a cloud service, containerized environment, memory layer, or any other execution context **does not** remove licensing obligations.

## 6.5 Model-Shift Clause  
Using any AI model (LLM, SLT, multimodal, local, cloud) to implement or reproduce the Method **does not** remove licensing obligations.

---

# 7. ANTI-EVASION CLAUSE

Attempts to circumvent this license do **not** remove applicability, including:

- renaming concepts or components, 
- restructuring files or schema, 
- splitting logic across modules, 
- rephrasing procedural descriptions, 
- altering terminology, 
- recreating the architecture with different wording, 
- changing the storage layer, 
- building “from scratch” systems replicating the Method’s behaviour.

Functional equivalence is sufficient to trigger license obligation.

---

# 8. PROTECTED SUBJECT MATTER (METHOD + IMPLEMENTATION)

This license covers **both**:

(A) the MetaMemoryArchitecture Method, and 
(B) all concrete implementations derived from or dependent on the Method.

Protected components include:

- structured and unstructured memory object classes, 
- log-based memory patterns, 
- document-based memory structures, 
- procedural state reconstruction, 
- multi-file interactions, 
- emergent cross-document behaviour, 
- format-agnostic storage patterns, 
- any interpretive logic producing continuity across sessions, 
- integration into LLM-driven or engine-driven systems.

Any reproduction of the Method, in any form, is subject to this license.

---

# 9. LIABILITY, WARRANTIES, AND NO IMPLIED RIGHTS

The Method is provided **as is**, without warranty of any kind. 
The Licensor is not liable for any damage arising from its use. 
Nothing in this license grants rights not explicitly stated here.

---

# 10. GLOBAL APPLICABILITY CLAUSE

This license applies globally to:

- all copies, 
- all derivatives, 
- all reconstructions, 
- all re-implementations, 
- all functionally equivalent systems — 
regardless of jurisdiction, runtime, model, engine, or intent.

---
